  "question": "What is an investment holding company?",
  "text": "In the realm of finance, various types of firms engage in investing in other companies. However, what sets holding companies apart is their ability to acquire a controlling stake that grants them the power to influence management decisions and shape the long-term strategic objectives of the target firm. Although holding companies secure a controlling stake, they also enjoy entitlement to the profits generated by their subsidiary companies. The share of profits they receive is determined by the extent of their controlling stake and is calculated after the subsidiary has accounted for all business expenses, cost of goods sold, interest, and tax payments. In addition to their strategic benefits, holding companies can provide tax advantages, particularly when the parent company is located in a region with a low tax rate. Furthermore, subsidiaries can be acquired in two ways: through the purchase of shares or through the decision of a larger entity to spin off a specific business unit.",

These are known as &apos;mixed holding companies. Additionally, there are other categories of holding companies, such as immediate and intermediate holding companies.
